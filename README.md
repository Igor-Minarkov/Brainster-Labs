# Brainster-Labs

Very simple, responsive, a small project which was project num 01 in my studies. The first page is a simple page with three buttons/filters which display cards of different academy projects/categories. On the second page, there is a form that allows us to send information about the student who is applying for a job. On the mobile version, we have changed the menu and added mobile pagination.
