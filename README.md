# BrainsterProjects

Very simple, responsive, small project which was project num 01 in my studies. The first page is simple page with three buttons/filters where we can display different academy projects/categories. On the second page, there is a form that allow us to send information about the student who is applying for a job. On the mobile version, we have different menu, and pagination.
